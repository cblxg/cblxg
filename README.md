## Hi there! I'm Li Mengzhu ðŸ‘‹

I'm a Master's graduate in Computer Technology from Shenzhen University, with a Bachelor's degree from Chongqing University. My research interests focus on **Embodied Intelligence**. I'm currently exploring robotics through ROS 2, MoveIt, and NVIDIA's Isaac Sim.

Feel free to connect or check out my projects!
